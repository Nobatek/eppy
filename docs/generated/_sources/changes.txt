- added a script that can compare two idf files. It is documented in "Useful Scripts". The script is in

- added two scripts that test if eppy works when new versions of energyplus are released. Documentation for this is not yet done. The scripts are
    - eppy/usefull_scripts/eppyreadtest_file.py

- fixed a bug where eppy would not read backslashes in a path name. Some idf objects have fields that are path names. On dos/windows machines these path names have backslashes
